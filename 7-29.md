## Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier

### Pick two or three news sources and select a few news titles from their feed (about 5 is likely enough).  For example you could select CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, NPR, PBS, Al Jazeera, RT (Russia Today), Deutsche Welle, Facebook, BBC, France24, CCTV, NHK World or another source you wish you analyze.  Run your sarcasm model to predict whether the titles are interpreted as sarcastic or not.  Analyze the results and comment on the different news sources you have selected.

The numbers are probability of being sarcastic.

I chose my new sources to have a mix of supposed bias. Fox like CNN, is known to be a partisan news source. NPR is used for
contrast. It claims to be unpartisan. The Onion I chose because all of its headlines are sarcastic or ironic, as it isn't
a true news platform. I chose the articles from NPR as both contained quotations, to see if it would identify that as sarcastic.

I have no confidence in this sarcasm detector's performance on real headline's. It only had two successful predictions out of five.
It doesn't seem to view quotation marks sarcastic.


## Text generation with an RNN

### Use the generate_text() command at the end of the exercise to produce synthetic output from your RNN model.  Run it a second time and review the output.  How has your RNN model been able to “learn” and “remember” the shakespeare text in order to reproduce a similar output?

ROMEO: fetch my troth, and a true underately close the Duke of Jusining,
And in my kindred be might each other'd shret.

NORTHUMBERLAND:

The RNN seems to be taking the general format well, starting with a character name of sorts before every line. However, it 
has no sense of context and just looks at the word beforehand to try to predict the next word, instead of the entire sentence.
On occasion it spits out entire phrases it has learned from the text. 

### Stretch goal - replace the Shakespeare text with your own selected text and run the model again.  Modify the source text as needed in order to generate_text() from the newly trained model.

Here's some generated text from the Bee movie. It's mostly just random lines from the movie with slight changes or gibberish.
This model was definitely overfit. It had too little source text and too many epochs.

## Neural machine translation with attention

### Use the translate() command at the end of the exercise to translate three sentences from Spanish to English.  How did your translations turn out?

The translations did pretty well. This first translation was correct.

Input: <start> esta es mi vida . <end>
Predicted translation: this is my life . <end> 

This was close, it understood that it was a question about being at home. You should probably be they in this sentence.

Input: <start> ¿ todavia estan en casa ? <end>
Predicted translation: are you still at home ? <end> 

This last translation got the right types of words, but it comes out with the wrong idea. It should translate to "try to find out".
Which can have a different meaning from try to figure it out.

Input: <start> trata de averiguarlo . <end>
Predicted translation: try to figure it out . <end>
